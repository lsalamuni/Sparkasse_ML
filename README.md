The project involves developing models for classifying banking e-mails into 12 categories (e.g. TAN procedure, fees, phishing, ...) with a high degree of class imbalance. Extensive feature engineering, including structural indicators, banking-specific keyword counts, and n-gram TF-IDF representations, is applied to address potential overfitting and reduce dimensionality. 
Three classification algorithms are implemented: Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Ensemble. 
Model performance is evaluated using a broad set of metrics, including Macro-F1, Weighted-F1, accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC, and Log-Loss, alongside confusion matrices and per- class error rates.
